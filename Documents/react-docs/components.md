# Components

Components allow us to separate the user interface into independent pieces.
Components accept arbitrary inputs, called props, and return to React elements that describe what should be seen on the screen.

## Function component

The simplest way to define a component is by means of a JavaScript function.

[Example](/React/Component/function-component.jsx)

## Styles in React

- Create a css file for the component styles.
- Import the css file to the jsx file.

## Reuse of components

reusability of components is the most important thing and this can be achieved by means of props.

[Example](/React/Component/reuse-of-component.jsx)
