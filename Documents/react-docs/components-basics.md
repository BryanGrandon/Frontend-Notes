# Components Basics

## JavaScript XML ( _JSX_ )

React extension for JavaScript syntax

Allow us to describe in JavaScript how the components will look like using a structure similar to HTML.

## Properties ( _props_ )

- Props are arguments that can be received by a React component.
- Props can only be sent from "parent to child".

## State

Representation in JavaScript of the set of properties of a component and their current values.

In this concept, "properties" does not refer to the props.

### Hooks

Special function that allow you to work with states in functional components and other aspects of React.

### Event Listener

A JavaScript function that is executed when a specific event occurs.

## Composition vs Inheritance

React has a powerful composition model, and it is recommended to use composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.
