# All About Variables

Variables are containers for storing data

- To declare variables, we use one of the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.
- To assign a value, we use the `=` followed by the _value_.

## Hoisting

- Lexical environment: _Stores variables and functions in memory_
- Temporal Dead Zone: _Cannot access "variables" before initialization_

## Variables Scopes

- Global scope: _It can be accessed from anywhere within the same JavaScript code_
- Function scope: _Variables declared inside a function can only be used inside that same function_
- Block scope: _Variables declared within a block cannot be accessed outside of that block_
