# Data Type

Data type refers to the type of data that a JavaScript variable can hold.

## [Primitive Type](/JavaScript/Lenguage/data-types/primitive-type.js)

In JavaScript, a primitive value is a data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types

- String
- Number
- Bigint
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol

## [Object](/JavaScript/Lenguage/data-types/object-type.js)

JavaScript object is a data structure that allows us to have key-value pairs; so we can have distinct keys and each key is mapped to a value that can be of any JavaScript data type.

- _Object.assign_
- _Object.defineProperty_

## [Built in Objects](/JavaScript/Lenguage/data-types/built-in-objects.js)

Built-in objects, or “global objects”, are those built into the language specification itself.

- _Console object_
- _Date object_
- _Math object_
- _String_
