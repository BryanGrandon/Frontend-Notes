# Control Flow

In JavaScript, the Control flow is a way of how your computer runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the first line and ends at the last line unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow of the program such as loops, conditionals, etc.

## [Conditional statements](/JavaScript/Lenguage/control-flow/conditional-statements.js)

When you write code, you often want to perform different actions for different decisions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

- `IF` - `ELSE`
- `Switch`

## [Exception Handling](/JavaScript/Lenguage/control-flow/exception-handling.js)

In JavaScript, all exceptions are simply objects. While the majority of exceptions are implementations of the global Error class, any old object can be thrown.

- `Try` - `Catch` - `Finally`
- `Throw`
