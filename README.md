## Introduction

This project is where i add what i learn about the technologies used in Frontend. Besides having a sort of record of what i've learned, it's a quick way to find information that I've forgotten.

## Internet

    alt="Version control system" 
    height="250" 
  />
</p>

Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase/files over time. They allow you to go back to some previous version of the codebase without any issues. Also, they help in collaborating with people working on the same code.

- Git

  - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

  - [Best practices for writing commits in Git](/docs/git.md)

- Repo Hosting Services

  - There are different repository hosting services, the most famous being GitHub, GitLab and BitBuck.
