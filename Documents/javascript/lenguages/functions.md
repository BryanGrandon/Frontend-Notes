# Functions

Functions exist so we can reuse code. They are blocks of code that execute whenever they are invoked. Each function is typically written to perform a particular task.

## [Function](/JavaScript/Lenguage/functions/function.js)

The function name should clearly describe what the function does.

### Arrow Function

Arrow Function is a new way of creating functions with the ’=>’ operator with a shorter syntax.

```js
const arrowFunction = () => {};
```

### IIFE

Immediately-Invoked Function Expression is a function that is executed immediately after it is created.

```js
(function () {})();
```

### Arguments Object

The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function, available within all non-arrow functions.
