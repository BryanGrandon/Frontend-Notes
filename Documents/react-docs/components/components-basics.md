# Components Basics

## [JSX](/React/Component/components-basics/js-jsx.jsx)

Allow us to describe in JavaScript how the components will look like using a structure similar to HTML.

| Language | Code                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| JSX      | `<button>Link<button/>`                        |
| JS       | `React.createElement("button", null, "Like");` |

## [Props](/React/Component/components-basics/props.jsx)

- Props are arguments that can be received by a React component.
- Props can only be sent from "parent to child".

## State

Representation in JavaScript of the set of properties of a component and their current values.

## Composition vs Inheritance

React has a powerful composition model, and it is recommended to use composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.
