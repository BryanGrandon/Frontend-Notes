## 🌐 Internet Basics

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through standardized protocols, enabling the exchange of data worldwide.

### Key Concepts

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**  
  A communication protocol based on TCP/IP that defines how clients and servers exchange information.

- **Domain Name**  
  A human-readable address (e.g., `google.com`) that maps to an IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS).

- **Hosting**  
  A service that stores website files on servers, making them accessible to users via the internet.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
  Translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can load web resources correctly.

- **Browser**  
  A software application that allows users to access, render, and interact with web content.

## 🧱 [HTML](https://github.com/BryanGrandon/HTML-Notes)

HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is the backbone of the web.  
It defines the **structure and content** of web pages, which can later be styled with CSS and enhanced with JavaScript.

### Topics Covered

- **Accessibility**  
  Designing and developing websites so that people with disabilities can use them effectively.

- **SEO Basics**  
  Search Engine Optimization techniques to improve visibility and ranking in search engines.

## 🎨 [CSS](https://github.com/BryanGrandon/CSS-Notes)

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the language used to style and visually organize web pages.  
It plays a fundamental role in layout, responsiveness, accessibility, and overall user experience.

CSS allows developers to transform plain HTML into visually appealing, interactive, and responsive interfaces across different devices and screen sizes.

### ⚙️ CSS Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors extend the capabilities of standard CSS by adding features such as:

- Variables
- Nesting
- Mixins
- Modular files

These tools help write cleaner, more reusable, and more maintainable styles.

- 📄 [Sass](./docs/sass.md)

### 🎯 CSS Framework

CSS frameworks provide prebuilt utility classes and components to speed up development and ensure consistent design.

- 📄 [Tailwind]()

## ⚙️ [JavaScript](https://github.com/BryanGrandon/JavaScript-Notes)

JavaScript is a versatile, interpreted programming language that brings **interactivity and dynamic behavior** to web applications.

### Topics Covered

- **DOM Manipulation**  
  Interacting with and updating the structure, content, and styles of a webpage dynamically.

- **APIs**  
  Interfaces that allow different applications to communicate and share functionality.

---

## 🧠 Version Control Systems

Version control systems track changes in your codebase over time, making collaboration easier and allowing you to revert to previous versions when needed.

### Tools

- **[Git](/docs/git.md)**  
  A distributed version control system designed for speed, efficiency, and collaboration.

- **Repository Hosting Services**  
  Platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket that host and manage Git repositories.

---

## 📦 Package Managers

Package managers handle project dependencies, ensuring consistency and simplifying development workflows.

### Common Tools

- **npm**  
  The default package manager for Node.js, maintained by npm, Inc.

- **pnpm**  
  Uses a global content-addressable store to save disk space and improve performance.

- **Yarn**  
  A fast and secure alternative to npm focused on reliability and consistency.

## ⚛️ Frameworks

Frameworks provide structured solutions and reusable components to build scalable web applications efficiently.

### Popular Frameworks

- [React](https://github.com/BryanGrandon/React-Notes)
- Angular
- Vue.js

---

## 🧪 Type Checkers

Type checkers help reduce bugs by adding static types to code, catching errors early during development.

### Tools

- **[TypeScript](https://github.com/BryanGrandon/Typescript-Notes)**  
  A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
