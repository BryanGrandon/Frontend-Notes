## 🌐 Internet Basics

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through standardized protocols, enabling the exchange of data worldwide.

### Key Concepts

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**  
  A communication protocol based on TCP/IP that defines how clients and servers exchange information.

- **Hosting**  
  A service that stores website files on servers, making them accessible to users via the internet.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
  Translates domain names into IP addresses so browsers can load web resources correctly.

- **Browser**  
  A software application that allows users to access, render, and interact with web content.
