# Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

- [Class](/JavaScript/Lenguage/classes/class.js)
- [Getter and Setter](/JavaScript/Lenguage/classes/getter-setter.js)
- [Inheritance](/JavaScript/Lenguage/classes/inheritance.js)

## Additional

- Protected properties are usually prefixed with the underscore `_`.
- Privates should start with `#`. They are only accessible from inside the class.
- [Static](/JavaScript/Lenguage/classes/additional/static.js)
